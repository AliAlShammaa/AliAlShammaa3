              I am a 1st year Computer Science student at UWaterloo in Ontario,
              Canada. I am passionate about problem-solving and ready to take on
              any challenge that tests my skills in computer science, math and
              more...

              I recently finnished an internship at Atlas365 where I worked on

              In the future, I see myself researching new technologies from
              Artificial Intelligence to Quantum Computers. In my free time, I
              do Web development, bot automation and sometimes (hehehe not
              always 😂) workout!!
